Fashion-MNIST Clothing Images Classification Individual Project September 2019 - November 2019

● Implemented a Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network and evaluated its performance in classifying clothing images.

● Construct a Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) with open-source neural-network library Keras and Sklearns library.

● Normalized multidimensional training and testing data, used the data for feed propagation, performed error calculation and back
propagation.
